The goal of the AptEase project is to provide a conversational, intuitive platform that allows people to look for apartments without the need for formal filters by using natural language. The query from the user is converted into SQL query and is used to fetch details from the database. The generated output is then presented in a summarized form to help users view the results at a glance. We made use of a pretrained T5 model, which was fine tuned using three different datasets, each containing 80k samples. This resulted in the model achieving an overall rogue-1 score of 87.
